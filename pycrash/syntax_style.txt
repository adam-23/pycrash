# List of syntax and style rules to adhere to when programming in Python
1. Use underscore, not hyphens. 
2. Avoid camelcase because it looks like shit, but use it when needed. 
3. Document everything, and do it using comments under each "block" of relevant code. 
4. Begin each program with a comment stating the exact name of the program, followed by "by Adam"
5. The second line of each separate program includes a summary of the program's main purpose. 
6. use explicit but concise variable and function name schemes. 
7. Directly below the function and class names, make sure to comment their explicit function.
